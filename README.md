# Genetic (Evolutional) algorithm
This repository is an implementation of modified genetic algorithm, which we call Evolutional Algorithm. It is adapted to solve P||C<sub>max</sub> problem. Besides the implementation of the algorithm, this repo contains utlilities that help test it, such as benchmark generator or simple greedy algorithm
